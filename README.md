# RubiksCubeSolver

#### Personal Project

#### Description 
##### The application models a rubik's cube such that moves in the 3D real world are shown on a 2D surface. The application allows the user to either scan in a real cube using their camera or auto populate a cube. From there the user can either make individual moves or choose to display the solution for this permutation of the cube. 
##### _Note: Plans to enhance the AI component of solving the cube to better optimize the soltions. Plans also to change 2D visual to 3D._ 

#### Language(s)
##### Java
